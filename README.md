Remark:

* I want to visualise the 18-dimensional data (obtained from https://github.com/TK-KXS/deep-learning-based-golf-swing-sequencing-analysis) using various dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA, MDS, Isomap, and t-SNE to determine if we can cluster the data.

* The algorithms mentioned above are created from scratch based on the mathematical concepts and optimisation problems I've learned from the modules.

* The mathematical explanation of each procedure of those algorithms will be published soon in the next version.

* Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or feedback!
